Fabio Moioli,"As we sail into the AI era accompanied by remote work dynamics, the relevance of middle management is being questioned. Many predict a phase-out of these pivotal roles, with AI replacing the managerial middle layer. But is this the true picture?Good middle managers are the nexus between senior executives and frontline staff, translating high-level strategies into actionable steps. Their empathetic understanding, conflict resolution, and communication skills are unparalleled - attributes not replicable by AI.While AI excels in data analytics, it falls short in understanding human intricacies and making judgment calls in ambiguous situations, a forte of seasoned middle managers. Their nuanced comprehension of operational ethics, regulatory compliance, and human interaction positions them as invaluable assets, particularly as ethical stewards in the implementation of AI technologies.In fact, AI could enhance, not replace, the effectiveness of middle managers by offering predictive insights, streamlining operational processes, and unearthing new market opportunities. Their ability to engineer prompts, crucial for guiding AI models, highlights their indispensable role further.As we embark on this AI-driven voyage, middle managers might not just retain their relevance, but emerge as linchpins steering both human and machine resources efficiently. The alliance of middle managers and AI could herald a new epoch of organizational success.I hope you may read the detailed exploration of this in my latest Forbes article, 'The Indispensable Role Of Middle Management In The AI Era', published today. The human element of middle management is irreplaceable, even in the face of advancing AI. We may be entering the golden age of middle managers. Welcome to the golden age of middle management, redefined and supercharged by artificial intelligence.#MiddleManagement #AI #FutureOfWork #Management #ArtificialIntelligence #BusinessStrategy"
Fabio Moioli,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being used to automate many tasks and processes, from developing sophisticated algorithms for financial markets to controlling autonomous vehicles and industrial equipment. The potential of AI to revolutionize the world's workforce is immense, and it is now beginning to penetrate the human resources (HR) space as well.

You may find articles online on how the introduction of AI into HR will not only change the way HR departments work but also the way in which companies recruit, develop and manage their employees. They might discuss how AI is ""transforming"" and ""revolutionizing"" HR by automating many of the tedious and time-consuming tasks associated with it such as candidate screening, performance reviews and employee engagement.

Chatbots, data analysis and predictive analytics are being used to streamline HR processes, increase efficiency and reduce costs. This evolution has many HR teams considering leveraging its capabilities to further enhance their daily operations.

However, if an AI system is not properly calibrated, it can lead to biased hiring decisions. AI systems are also vulnerable to hacking and data breaches, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive employee information. From certain perspectives, it is even arguable that HR should remain one of the functions with lower usage of AI—or at least with the most ""cautious"" usage of it.

AI-powered systems can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately but lack the ability to make complex judgments that fully take into consideration culture, values, ethics, purpose and human empathy. HR professionals have the skills and experience to evaluate a wide range of factors and make decisions based on a variety of perspectives.

AI can certainly streamline a plethora of laborious and time-intensive tasks linked to Human Resources, including candidate screening, performance evaluations, and employee engagement. However, this perspective is fully applicable only if these duties are viewed merely as ""tedious and time-consuming tasks.""

Alternatively, if these activities are appropriately recognized as pivotal for any company's future, they should be preserved predominantly for the insightful, empathetic human touch. We must ensure that HR critical functions will continue to be handled with the inherent richness and depth that only we, human beings, can provide. Today, and in the future.

Shubam Tripathi-  Global HR Lead- Top HR Voice SPHR/ GPHR/ BHR/PHR/AIHR Certified,"HR Technology Trends in 2023: Digitalization with a Human Touch.

In general, technology trends are a response to industry trends that best demonstrate the needs and challenges of human resources..Let's deep down with below pointers ::-

1) Technologies for Workplace Digitalization- One way that businesses are hybridizing their workplace involves using a centralized platform that allows employees to connect various applications together. In addition, many businesses are enriching their internal communication with multimedia content like videos and images.

There are a number of innovations that help digitize the workplace:

- Immersive technologies (the metaverse)
- Digital and automated onboarding
- Online collaboration apps and platforms

2) Augmented Reality in the HR Industry- Immersive technologies are having a powerful influence on many industries around the world. With AR-compatible smartphones being nearly ubiquitous, the potential for augmented reality development to enhance human resources can’t be ignored.A common way that AR is used in workplaces is for training. Depending on the context, AR can be a powerful learning tool for gaining context about objects and environments in the real world.

3) Artificial Intelligence in HRM- AI is making waves in just about every industry right now, and human resources management is no exception. One way that AI can improve HR is through elimination of bias in the recruitment process. Since AI acts autonomously, it can review applicant information more fairly. However, we must remember that for this to happen, the training data itself must be free of bias that could affect the AI’s judgment.

4) HR Chatbot & Virtual Assistant - This also allows HR teams to spend more time on other tasks that can help enrich their teams.
Chatbots can be used for a few different purposes in HR: Assessing employment candidatesMaking onboarding processes more efficientSupporting employee training and engagement

5) AI-BASED CANDIDATE RECOMMENDATION ENGINES

With the increase in the amount of data in the HR field, their effective management becomes an important issue for organizations. Recommender systems can significantly improve hiring processes. Example, selecting a candidate with the desired professional skills, sorting the most suitable interviewers in order of importance. Or vice versa, the system can recommend a vacancy to the candidate based on his profile.

6) People Analytics & Employee Tracking-  There are a few different kinds of people analytics to consider ::-
- Descriptive
- Diagnostic
- Predictive
- Prescriptive
- Sentimental

Human resources teams need to be flexible with regard to technology. The tides are changing as the years go by, and waves of disruption and innovation can go by at a dizzying pace. Keeping up with it all and being ready to pivot is critical to HR and Process success.

This initiative is aimed at revolutionising the education sector through innovative technology-driven learning which is one of the key areas of NEP 2020.As per a Mathrubhoomi report, the AI school is a result of a collaboration between iLearning Engines (ILE) USA and Vedhik eSchool. The people working on this project are experts like former Chief Secretaries, DGPs, and Vice Chancellors.If you're thinking that the school won't have human teachers and instead ChatGPT will be teaching the kids in the classroom, you need to wait a bit, because that's not happening just yet.In this context, it simply means that an educational institution that utilises Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced technological systems to enhance the learning experience for students. It involves the integration of AI technologies, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and data analysis, into various aspects of education, including curriculum design, personalised learning, assessment, and student support.Here are some of the key features of India’s first AI school:—At first, the AI school will be for students in grades 8 to 12. —The AI school isn't only for regular school stuff. It also prepares students for big exams like JEE, NEET, CUET, CLAT, GMAT, and IELTS. —The online resources, which are made using artificial intelligence, are on the school's website.—The AI school will try to solve lots of problems for parents as well.#education"

Aditya Parihar,"Successful organizations start with a plan that includes- Defining goals and objectives, Gathering relevant data, Analysing and Evaluating, Implementing and proper Monitoring, and finally Reacting and Adjusting as per the market shift.Organizations begin with a list of priorities in order to achieve strategic business goals and critical results. This is the plan. Its objectives guide is finding how resources are allocated throughout the organization, from costs to expenses to human capital to capacity, and more. Decisions must be made based on historical facts in order to create feasible targets, budgets, and timeframes. For example, if a company wants to boost output by 5% to meet a 5% increase in demand, it can study the prior year's production data and modify the appropriate inputs to inventory and staffing to achieve this 5% increase. Will extra equipment be required, as well as additional personnel, to meet this increase? Is it still profitable to boost output with these fresh investments? To answer these issues and deploy the necessary resources, historical data must be reliable and available to decision-makers. When data is kept in diverse forms in various locations with no access or protection, availability is difficult.Best-in-class organizations are investing in integrated planning practices and advanced analytical capabilities to augment human intelligence.Analysts agree that best-in-class organizations are investing in continuous integrated planning and analysis:•      Connecting: 43% of best-in-class organizations can connect and analyze financial and operational data (Aberdeen: Unifying workforce planning behind a single system of truth: A fresh look, June 2021)•      Extending: 70% of new FP&A projects will become continuous integrated planning and analysis projects by 2024 (https://lnkd.in/dTm7M8KH)•      Infusing: 50% of organizations are planning to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) in the coming years and 70% of these companies are rating the value delivered during the planning process as Very High or High (https://lnkd.in/d97MFTWw)Planning isn't just for Finance. All departments and disciplines, including operations, sales, marketing, human resources, and others, require quick, flexible planning and analysis. Tools that provide insight and aid in performance management are required.See how Solar Coca-Cola transformed its spreadsheet-based planning process into a continuous, integrated planning platform using the IBM Planning Analytics Solution: https://lnkd.in/dthw_NFU#businessandmanagement #financeandeconomy #planningandanalytics"

Raja Gupta,"A Beginner's Guide to Understand Major Solutions, Services and Platforms in SAP Ecosystem.

If you are new to SAP, you will be overwhelmed by the wide range of solutions, services and platforms SAP offers that drive digital transformation for businesses of all sizes. However, understanding the full spectrum of these offerings can be challenging, especially for those new to the SAP ecosystem.

I just published a blog, where I broke down these wide range of solutions, services and platforms into digestible bits, making it easy for a beginner to understand
https://lnkd.in/gHmRBtwb


Here are some important snippets from the blog for quick read.
𝐒𝐀𝐏 𝐒/4𝐇𝐀𝐍𝐀
SAP S/4HANA is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that helps companies manage their operations more efficiently. It integrates various functions like finance, sales, procurement, manufacturing, and more into a single, streamlined system.

Let’s understand it with an example:
Imagine you run a retail business that sells clothing. You have multiple stores, an online platform, and a warehouse where you store your inventory. Before implementing SAP S/4HANA, you used different software systems to manage your finances, sales, inventory, and other operations. Each system had its own data and required manual effort to update and reconcile information.

Now, with SAP S/4HANA, all these processes can be unified into a single system. You can track your inventory levels, sales, and financial transactions in real-time, all within the same software. For instance, when a customer purchases an item from your online store, the inventory is automatically updated across all channels, ensuring accurate stock information.

Moreover, SAP S/4HANA utilizes advanced technologies like in-memory computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This enables you to gain valuable insights from your data and make informed decisions. For instance, you can analyse sales trends, identify popular products, forecast demand, and optimize your supply chain accordingly.


𝐒𝐀𝐏 𝐒𝐮𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬
SAP SuccessFactors is a cloud-based human resource software, which covers everything from core HR, payroll, and people analytics to the four pillars of talent management: recruiting, learning and development, compensation, and performance management.
Imagine you’re running a company and you want to make sure you have the right people in the right roles, and that they’re motivated and performing well. SAP SuccessFactors is like a digital assistant that helps you manage your employees effectively.

With SAP SuccessFactors, you can handle tasks like hiring new employees, setting performance goals, conducting performance reviews, and providing training and.....

Neeraj Kumar K,"#singularity is not decades but years away, says scientist.

With the advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, an #ai expert has claimed that the day is not far when AI will surpass the control of humans.
Before the wide acceptance and adoption of generative AI, experts and theorists had speculated that technological singularity was decades away.

However, with growing competition in this area by tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Elon Musk's xAI, Ben Goertzel, CEO of AI and blockchain developer SingularityNET, believes the beginning of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is years, and not decades, away.

“I would say now, three to eight years is my take, and the reason is partly that large language models like Meta's Llama2 and OpenAI's GPT-4 help and are genuine progress,” Goertzel told Decrypt.

“These systems have greatly increased the enthusiasm of the world for AGI, so you'll have more resources, both money and just human energy—more smart young people want to plunge into work and working on AGI.”
What is singularity?
Singularity is a theoretical point where technological advancement either becomes equivalent to or tops human intelligence.

The point of singularity has the potential to make severe shifts to human civilization.

The experts have long weighed in on the possibility of reaching singularity in the near future claiming that the intelligence of humans is fixed but the case does not stand true for machines as with the advancement and mainstream adoption of AI, it can outperform us at any given time.

Factors pushing advancement of AI
Geortzel, while emphasising the major factor pushing the development of artificial intelligence, said it was humanity’s restlessness that was not only behind the advancement of technology but also the determinant for other massive transformations."

Akshay Toshniwal,"3 Common Questions about Artificial Intelligence -

Artificial Intelligence (AI) as we all know is changing the way businesses operate and is truly transforming the end-user perspective.

Though, adapting a data-driven or an AI-driven approach is not straightforward. One needs to have answers to important questions before embracing AI-based solutions and systems.

This is important to make use of AI in the most efficient manner possible. With the speed at which AI is growing, it is not possible to build a solution with everything that AI has to offer.

In the world of AI, we have areas like Predictive Analytics, Telemetry Forecasting, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and now Generative AI (one of the most trending areas of all time). Not all of it can help an organization.

Gartner publishes 3 broad & common questions about AI which will possibly help understand the usage/implementation. They are:

1️⃣ How can you capture the AI opportunity?
Solutions & use cases identified where AI & automation for generating insights can be identified.

2️⃣ What can AI do for an organization?
Multiple facets of AI- digital transformation, less intervention of humans, savings in terms of resources, better & improved outcomes, and much more.

3️⃣ How is generative AI different from other forms of AI?
One of the AI techniques that helps in creating content in the form of textual data, images, videos, and/or audio. The best part is the creation of content based on raw & natural language input.

Answering the above 3 questions will enable better clarity and understanding of how things should be taken forward.

AI is changing the world. It's time we start embracing it.
